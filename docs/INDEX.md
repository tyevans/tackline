# Skill & Agent Navigator

Quick reference for finding the right skill or agent. See also: [Cookbook](primitives-cookbook.md), [Recipes](primitives-recipes.md), [Team Guide](team-system-guide.md).

## Decision Tree

**I want to...**

- **Explore something unknown** -> /blossom (broad, spike-driven) or /fractal (focused, goal-directed)
- **Research a specific topic** -> /gather (collect findings) -> /distill (condense) -> /rank (prioritize)
- **Compare approaches** -> /diff-ideas (two options) or /consensus (three independent proposals)
- **Plan before building** -> /decompose (break down) -> /plan (sequence) -> /spec (full specification)
- **Assess risk** -> /premortem (failure analysis) or /critique (adversarial review)
- **Bootstrap a new project** -> /bootstrap (full setup: infrastructure + agents)
- **Build something** -> /tracer (iterative end-to-end) or /sketch (skeleton only)
- **Implement a full plan autonomously** -> /drive (sustained sprint/retro cycles until done)
- **Deploy something** -> /deploy (readiness gate, strategy selection, execution, monitoring, rollback)
- **Optimize something** -> /optimize (profile -> bottleneck -> fix -> measure -> iterate)
- **Test an implementation** -> /test-strategy (classify spec type, write tests, enforce red-green gates)
- **Review code** -> /review (structured static review) or /review-meeting (interactive panel review with implementer + reviewers)
- **File a bug** -> /bug (structured bug report to backlog)
- **Understand a definition's history** -> /evolution (file change history and stability) or /drift (cross-definition convergence/divergence)
- **Manage a team** -> /assemble (create) -> /standup (sync) -> /sprint (dispatch)
- **Understand an agent's capabilities** -> /diagnose-agent (struggle profile from historical evidence)
- **Generate training challenges** -> /challenge-gen (targeted challenges from struggle profile)
- **Run challenges and evaluate** -> /challenge-run (dispatch agent, evaluate performance)
- **Improve agent capabilities** -> /active-learn (full adversarial training loop: diagnose -> challenge -> evaluate -> learn)
- **Optimize agent learnings for upcoming work** -> /curate (score, prune, fill gaps) -> /promote (graduate to rules) — or use /tend to run all three
- **Audit project rules for health** -> /curate rules (score rules, passive context budget, gap detection)
- **Run a session** -> /status (orient) -> /advise (recommendations) -> ... work ... -> /retro (reflect) -> /handoff (transition)
- **Discuss with multiple perspectives** -> /meeting (interactive group dialogue)
- **Plan a goal with your team** -> /team-meeting (collaborative planning -> sprint-ready tasks)
- **Just do something** -> /do (match goal to skill/pipeline and execute it)
- **Find the right skill for a goal** -> /discover (semantic recommendation + pipeline suggestion)
- **Distribute work across multiple humans** -> /storm-prep (prep) -> human jam session -> /formalize (contracts) -> /sprint (execute) -> /integrate (merge)

## Skills by Category

Skills are organized into three layers in the repo (`skills/core/`, `skills/workflows/`, `skills/teams/`) and flattened on install.

### Core (16) — `skills/core/`

Composable primitives following [pipe format](../rules/pipe-format.md), plus the routing entrypoints. Stateless — output of any primitive feeds the next via conversation context.

| Skill | Purpose | Chain Position |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| /gather | Collect information with sources and confidence | Input |
| /decompose | Break a goal into bounded sub-parts | Transform |
| /distill | Reduce verbose input to essentials | Transform |
| /expand | Elaborate sparse items into detailed descriptions (inverse of distill) | Transform |
| /transform | Apply a rewrite instruction to every item independently (map) | Transform |
| /rank | Score and order items by criteria | Transform |
| /filter | Binary keep/drop by criterion | Transform |
| /assess | Categorize items by rubric (critical/warning/ok) | Transform |
| /verify | Check claims against evidence | Transform |
| /critique | Adversarial review — what's wrong, missing, risky | Transform |
| /diff-ideas | Compare two approaches side-by-side | Transform |
| /merge | Combine multiple pipe-format blocks into one | Transform |
| /plan | Dependency-aware execution sequence | Output |
| /sketch | Structural skeleton with TODOs (code, docs, configs, schemas) | Output |
| /do | Primary entrypoint: match goal to skill/pipeline and execute it | Router |
| /discover | Recommend skills or pipelines for a described goal | Router |

### Workflows (29) — `skills/workflows/`

## Skills by Context Type

**Inline (42):** gather, distill, expand, transform, rank, filter, assess, verify, sketch, merge, decompose, critique, plan, diff-ideas, do, discover, fractal, meeting, review-meeting, bug, session-health, handoff, status, advise, evolution, drift, diagnose-agent, challenge-gen, challenge-run, domain, assemble, standup, sprint, team-meeting, curate, promote, tend, retro, storm-prep, formalize, integrate, drive

**Fork (12):** blossom, bootstrap, consensus, consolidate, deploy, optimize, premortem, review, spec, test-strategy, tracer, active-learn

Fork skills run in an isolated context to avoid polluting the main conversation. Use fork skills for heavy exploration; use inline skills for quick operations within the current flow.

## Primitive Chain Patterns

Common composition sequences (each step's output feeds the next via context):

```
/gather -> /distill -> /rank          # Research -> condense -> prioritize
/gather -> /filter -> /verify         # Research -> narrow -> fact-check
/decompose -> /rank -> /plan          # Break down -> prioritize -> sequence
/gather -> /critique -> /rank         # Research -> stress-test -> prioritize
/gather -> /diff-ideas                # Research -> compare two approaches
/gather -> /distill -> /sketch        # Research -> condense -> prototype
/critique -> /bug                     # Find flaws -> file as tracked issues
/review -> /bug                       # Code review -> file bugs from findings
/review-meeting -> /bug               # Interactive panel review -> file escalated findings
/gather -> /transform as ticket titles  # Research -> rewrite each finding as a ticket
/gather -> /distill -> /expand         # Research -> condense -> elaborate key findings
/drift -> /rank -> /sprint            # Compare definitions -> prioritize fixes -> execute
/tracer -> /optimize                  # Implement correctly -> then make it fast
/blossom -> /drive                    # Discover plan -> autonomously implement it
/spec -> /drive                       # Specify -> autonomously implement it
/diagnose-agent -> /challenge-gen     # Profile agent -> generate targeted challenges
/diagnose-agent -> /challenge-gen -> /challenge-run  # Profile -> challenges -> evaluate
/active-learn                                       # Full loop: diagnose -> challenge -> evaluate -> learn (all inline)
/curate -> /promote                                 # Optimize learnings -> graduate to rules
/curate rules                                       # Audit project rules: scores, budget, gaps
/tend                                               # Full lifecycle: curate agents -> curate rules -> promote -> demotion -> summary
/storm-prep -> [human jam] -> /formalize -> /sprint -> /integrate  # Multi-human: prep -> negotiate -> contracts -> execute -> merge
```

**Note**: Multi-step chains (3+ primitives) are best run in the main session. If dispatching to a subagent, set `max_turns: 40` to avoid turn limits.

### File-Based Intermediate Results

For chains that may span compression events, save intermediate output to a file and pass the file path to the next primitive:

```bash
# Step 1: Run first primitive and save output
User: /gather authentication patterns in this codebase
  -> produces pipe-format output
User: Save the gather output above to /tmp/auth-findings.md

# Step 2: After compression or in a new session
User: /distill /tmp/auth-findings.md
  -> reads file instead of scanning context
User: /rank by security risk
  -> continues chain from distill output
```

This pattern is especially useful for:
- Long-running sessions where compression may occur between primitives
- Preserving research findings across session boundaries
- Sharing primitive output with subagents (pass file path in task prompt)

## Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Scope |
|-------|---------|-------|
| agent-generator | Generate project-specific agents | Global |
| project-bootstrapper | Bootstrap projects with Claude Code setup | Global |
| code-reviewer | Read-only code review | Global |

8 additional project-local agents live in `.claude/agents/` for authoring, research, and maintenance tasks specific to this repo.
